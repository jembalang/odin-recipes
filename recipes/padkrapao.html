        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my favorite go to for a quick <strong>thai cuisine</strong> after a long day.
        It is simple to cook, and with the right ingredients, it will taste great! </p>
        
        <p>The ingredients are not that hard to find if you live in Malaysia.
            Maybe you need to find some holy basil / thai basil at the premium supermarket
            but other than that, everything else is common.
