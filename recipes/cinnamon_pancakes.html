        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>My wife loves pancakes. With this twist, I added a little cinnamon.
            Best served with a some butter and maple syrup or honey if you prefer.
        </p>

        <p>It is fairly easy to make with simple ingredients.
            As close as you can get to an &apos;almost&apos; <em>American Breakfast</em>.
        </p>

                on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a plate and keeep warm while cooking the
